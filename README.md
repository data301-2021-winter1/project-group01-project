Steam is one of the largest video game digital distribution services and is used by millions of people around the world. In this dataset information relating to the popularity of approximately 1200 steam games, spanning many genres like Action/Adventure, FPS, Third Person Shooter, RPG and Dungeon-Crawler, has been catalogued according to the month and year the data was recorded. The data recorded, going from July 2012 to February 2021, includes the average concurrent players, the gain/loss of average players from the previous month, highest concurrent players, and the share of the average in the maximum value. All together there are over 580,000 observations in this data set, allowing for many areas of investigation and analysis, all of which was collected from steamcharts.com, a website dedicated to the ongoing analysis of Steamâ€™s concurrent players, by the method of web scraping using R.
