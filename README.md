## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The general topic we will be focusing on is Video Games! All three of us are gamers, as we play a variety of video games, leading us to be interested in analyzing the different types of game analytics from the gaming community. We have chosen the gaming platform Steam to be our main data source for our dataset, as it offers a large pool of games and a consistent player base.  We also have the live game streaming platform Twitch as the data source to our backup dataset because it’s an interesting set of analytics on live steamers and watchers of specific games and genres. As gamers, looking into the datasets and the gaming analytics of the games we enjoy, like League of Legends, Call of Duty, Valorant, Overwatch, etc., will pique our interest in this group project even more! With all of this in mind, we believe we can use this dataset in a dashboard.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Steam is one of the largest video game digital distribution services and is used by millions of people around the world. In this dataset information relating to the popularity of approximately 1200 steam games, spanning many genres like Action/Adventure, FPS, Third Person Shooter, RPG and Dungeon-Crawler, has been catalogued according to the month and year the data was recorded. The data recorded, going from July 2012 to February 2021, includes the average concurrent players, the gain/loss of average players from the previous month, highest concurrent players, and the share of the average in the maximum value. All together there are over 580,000 observations in this data set, allowing for many areas of investigation and analysis, all of which was collected from steamcharts.com, a website dedicated to the ongoing analysis of Steam’s concurrent players, by the method of web scraping using R.
